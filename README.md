*"At the time, Nixon was normalizing relations with China.  I figured that if he could normalize relations, then so could I" - Ted Codd*

In the 1960s before relational databases, there were two popular data models, the network database model created by the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL), called Codasyl Data Model, and and a hierarchical database made by IBM called Information Management System (IMS) which was developed for the Apollo space program. 

In 1970, while working for IBM, Ted Codd wrote "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" which is the theoretical basis of the modern relational database, like MySQL and PostgreSQL. Codd's paper changed how people though about how data should be stored. Over the 1970s structured query languages started to develop until the Structured Query Language (SQL) became the standard in the 1980s

Don Chamberlin, the co-inventor of SQL said in IBM Research News in April 2003: "I could imagine how those queries would have been represented in CODASYL by programs that were five pages long that would navigate through this labyrinth of pointers and stuff. Codd would sort of write them down as one-liners. These would be queries like, "Find the employees who earn more than their managers."
